This branch contains the site generated from the Jekyll sources on the `master` branch. It's referenced as a submodule. You shouldn't have to edit this branch manually; it's updated by Circle CI whenever changes are made to `master`. This setup is described in detail at http://blog.blindgaenger.net/generate_github_pages_in_a_submodule.html.
